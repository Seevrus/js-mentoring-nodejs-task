# js-mentoring-nodejs-task

This is a task for js mentoring program.

Initial requirements:

1) Read a folder name from the console. It could be either an absolute path or relative one
2) Specify the depth for the folder lookup or leave it empty in order to use the maximum depth
3) Write the information about the inner forlder structure in a file in the current folder in json format (see example). Make each file have unique name.
4) All the code should be modular. Consider adding a module for file reader, for the interface and for output
6) Keep your code readable and pretty, add eslint to check the style
5) Don't use the 3rd party js libraries in the task, just plain node.js
